# 🚀 Pydantic Library — Learning and Implementation

## 🔍 What is Pydantic?

Pydantic is a Python library for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. It ensures data conforms to expected types and formats at runtime, providing automatic parsing, validation, and error handling with minimal boilerplate code.

## 📚 What I Learned by Implementing These Files

By creating and experimenting with various example scripts, I explored key features of Pydantic such as:

- ✅ **Basic Models and Field Validation** — Defining data models with strict typing.
- 🛠️ **Field Validators** — Using `@field_validator` to apply custom rules on individual fields.
- 🔗 **Model Validators** — Applying `@model_validator` for validations involving multiple fields.
- ⚙️ **Computed Fields** — Adding dynamic properties computed from model data via `@computed_field`.
- 🏗️ **Nested Models** — Handling hierarchical data by nesting models inside other models.
- 💾 **Serialization** — Efficiently converting models to dictionaries using `model_dump`.

These implementations deepened my understanding of how to use Pydantic effectively to ensure data integrity.

## 🎯 Why and What Pydantic Is Used For

Pydantic is designed to:

- Validate and parse input data robustly and reliably.
- Automate type coercion and error checking.
- Define maintainable, clear data models using Python’s typing system.
- Handle complex nested data structures gracefully.
- Support serialization and deserialization of data.
- Integrate seamlessly with frameworks like FastAPI for API validation.

## 🤖 How Pydantic Will Help Me in My ML Career

In machine learning, data quality is crucial. Pydantic helps by:

- Ensuring clean and validated input data to ML pipelines.
- Structuring experiment configs and parameters with type safety.
- Powering API endpoints for ML models with automatic request validation.
- Preventing errors caused by malformed data.
- Making codebase more readable and maintainable.

This improves the reliability of ML workflows and smoothens production deployment.
